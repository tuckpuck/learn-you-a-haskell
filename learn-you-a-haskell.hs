------ Haskell
-- Haskell is purely functional programming language. In functional programming you tell computer what stuff is as opposed to what to do. -- Functions have no side effects. The only thing they can do is calculate something and return a result.
-- Haskell is lazy. This means it won't execute functions unless it needs to show result. 
-- Haskell is statically typed. Compiler knows data type of different items in code, allowing errors to be caught at compile time.
-- Haskell uses type inference, which allows it to figure out which data is which type. 
-- Haskell is elegant and concise, with programs usually shorter than imperative equivalent. Easy to maintain and less bugs.

------ Logic
-- && - Boolean and
-- || - Boolean or 
-- not - negate 
-- True
-- False
-- == - equal
-- /= - not equal

---- Number Functions
-- succ - successor function, takes a parameter and returns the next number up
findSuccessor = succ 10
-- min - takes 2 parameters, returns the smaller one
findMinimum = min 111 222
-- max - takes 2 parameters, returns the larger one
findMaximum = max 111 222
-- div - takes two integers and executes an integral division. Returns how many times the first number can be divided by the second one
divisionMod = 92 `div` 10
-- Use standard divide operator to get a fractional return
divisionExact = 92 /  10

-- A prefix function can be changed to an infix function with ``
-- prefixFunc a b
-- a `infixFunc` b

-- If using a negative number, surround it in parenthesis 
-- (-3)

-- Operations will take place in the order of the precedence of operations (PEMDAS). 
-- Use parenthesis to define order of operations. 
-- Functions have the highest precedence of all operations in Haskell.

---- Function Definitions

-- Function name is followed by parameters separated by spaces. After parameters is = operator, followed by function body.
-- Functions can't begin with capital letters
doubleMe x = x + x
doubleTen = doubleMe 10
-- Takes two numbers, multiplies them by 2, and adds them together
doubleUs x y = x * 2 + y * 2
doubleTenTen = doubleUs 10 10 
-- Functions that you defiine can also call eachother. The above function could be redefined as:
doubleUsAgain x y = doubleMe x + doubleMe y

-- Multiplies a number by 2 if that number is less than 100. 
-- If must have else in haskell because every function must return a value in declarative languages
doubleSmallNumber x = if x > 100 then x else x * 2
-- Apostraphe denotes a strict version (not lazy), or a slightly modified version of a function with a similar name
doubleSmallNumber' x = (if x > 100 then x else x * 2) + 1

-- A definition or name takes no parameters and cannot be changed once set
myName = "Tucker Triggs"
